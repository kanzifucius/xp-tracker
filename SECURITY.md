## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Do NOT open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.**

To report a security vulnerability, use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature:

1. Navigate to the [xp-tracker repository](https://github.com/kanzifucius/xp-tracker)
2. Go to **Settings > Security > Report a vulnerability**
3. Fill out the report with the following information:
   - A clear description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce the issue
   - Affected versions
   - Potential impact and severity assessment

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgement**: Within 7 business days of your report.
- **Resolution**: Depends on the severity and complexity of the vulnerability. Critical issues will be prioritized.

You will be kept informed of progress toward a fix and any relevant decisions throughout the process.

## Disclosure Policy

This project follows a coordinated disclosure model:

1. The vulnerability is reported privately using the process described above.
2. The maintainers investigate and develop a fix.
3. A fix is released before any public announcement is made.
4. After the fix is available, a public advisory is published with appropriate credit to the reporter (unless anonymity is requested).

We ask that reporters refrain from publicly disclosing the vulnerability until a fix has been released.
